This is a example of a node.js API that manages books 

The data is in json format and self contained in the code.

You can use tools like cURL, Postman, or a web browser to interact with your API. Here are some examples:

Get all items: GET http://localhost:3000/books
Get a specific item by ID: GET http://localhost:3000/books/{jd}
Create a new item: POST http://localhost:3000/books with JSON payload
Update an item by ID: PUT http://localhost:3000/books/{id} with JSON payload
Delete an item by ID: DELETE http://localhost:3000/books/{id}
